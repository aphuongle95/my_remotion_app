## Implementation Steps

- [x] Create draggable and editable text
- [x] Implement undo/redo functionality
    - [x] Undoable text input
    - [x] Undoable text position
- [x] Add background video
- [x] Use `@remotion/player` instead of composition

This project showcases interactive features using Remotion, enhancing user experience with React-based video compositions.
